# Laptop Price Check & Smart Recommendations
This project focuses on providing customers with a comprehensive platform for checking and comparing laptop prices across different online retailers (in this case flipkart and amazon). In addition to price comparison, the system offers intelligent recommendations based on customer's preferences and requirements.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a laptop price check and recommendation system that assists customers in making informed purchasing decisions. The system leverages an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to collect laptop data from Flipkart and Amazon. The extracted data is then transformed and loaded into a structured format for further analysis.

## Features
**Price Comparison:** The project analyzes laptop data from Flipkart and Amazon to identify price variations for the same laptop models. Users can compare prices and find the best deals between the two platforms.

**Recommender System:** Based on user preferences, budget, and desired specifications, the project builds a recommender system that suggests laptops that best suit the user's needs. This feature enhances the user experience and aids in decision-making.

## Usage
To use the price comparison and recommender system:

1) Extract Data: Implement an ETL pipeline to collect laptop data from Flipkart and Amazon. This involves extracting the data, transforming it into a unified format, and loading it into a structured storage solution (such as a CSV file).

2) Data Storage: Configure the system to access the stored data and ensure that it can be quickly queried for tasks like pricing comparison and recommendation..

3) Price Comparison: Develop the necessary functionality to compare laptop prices across different retailers. Provide a user interface where customers can search for specific laptop models and view price comparisons.

4) Smart Recommendations: Implement algorithms that take customer preferences, budget, and desired specifications into account to generate personalized recommendations. Present these recommendations to customers through the user interface.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

Python 3.0

Data storage solution (CSV, database, etc.)

Libraries: numpy, pandas,beautifulsoup etc.
