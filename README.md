# Laptop Price Comparison and Recommender System
This project focuses on collecting laptop data from Flipkart and Amazon, comprising a total of 1000 records. The collected data is used for two main purposes: price comparison and building a recommender system for laptops.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide users with a comprehensive comparison of laptop prices and offer personalized recommendations based on their preferences. By leveraging the collected data, users can make informed decisions about purchasing laptops at the best available prices.

## Features
**Price Comparison:** The project analyzes laptop data from Flipkart and Amazon to identify price variations for the same laptop models. Users can compare prices and find the best deals between the two platforms.

**Recommender System:** Based on user preferences, budget, and desired specifications, the project builds a recommender system that suggests laptops that best suit the user's needs. This feature enhances the user experience and aids in decision-making.

## Usage
To use the price comparison and recommender system:

1 - Collect the laptop data from Flipkart and Amazon.

2 - Store the data in a structured format, such as a CSV or a database.

3 - Implement the necessary algorithms and functionalities to perform price comparison and recommendation tasks.

4 - Provide a user interface where users can search for specific laptop models, view price comparisons, and receive personalized recommendations.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

Python 3.x
Data storage solution (CSV, database, etc.)
Libraries: numpy, pandas,beautifulsoup etc.
